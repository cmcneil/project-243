#' Wine tasting experiment data
#'
#' The working example consists of a (fictitious) wine tasting experiment. 
#' The data concerns 12 wines made from Sauvignon Blanc grapes coming from 
#' three wine regions (4 wines from each region): New Zealand, France, and 
#' Canada. Ten expert assessors were asked to evaluate these wines. The 
#' assessors were asked:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item to evaluate the wines on 9-point rating scales, using four variables 
#'   considered as standard for the evaluation of these wines: cat-pee, 
#'   passion-fruit, green pepper, and mineral.
#'   \item if they felt the need, to add some variables of their own: some 
#'   assessors choose none, some choose one or two more variables.
